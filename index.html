                    <h3>CEDAR's Mission</h3>
                    <p>Our mission is to provide information and educational activites related to coal and energy for educators, students, and the general public in order to create an understanding of the many benefits the Coal Industry provides in our daily lives by providing financial resources and coal education materials.
                        <br>
                        We also provide opportunity, incentive, and encouragement to teachers and students to become problem solvers relative to either/or both of the following:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Investigate and identify the causes of the significant decline in the demand for coal as an energy source, and explore possible solutions to those causes, or possible new uses for coal, that could enable the industry to regain its prominence as a thriving industry within our region;</li>
                        <li> Investigate and research ways to re-purpose abandoned mined lands, and/or reclaimed mined lands that could help provide economic stimulation to our region.</li>
                    </ul>
