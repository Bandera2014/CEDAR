                        Our Coal Study Program provides teachers the opportunity to use their skills in creating, developing and implementing lesson plans about coal in their classroom, in one or more of the core content areas.<br> These include science, math, English/literature, art,music, technology/multi-media and/or social studies by awarding small grants to help with instructional materials and supply costs related to the Coal Study Unit.
                        
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        Teachers who are awarded grants for the coal study u its will be asked to submit a one page summary report and photo album upon completion of the coal study unit describing the impact the unit had on his/her students.

            <h2>Coal Days</h2>

            <p>
                Our Coal Days is an opportunity that allow participants (mostly elementary and high school students)  to learn more about the coal industry and coal mining through many different ways.<br>
                On Coal Days Participants have the opportunity to interact with members of the Indiana coal industry firsthand to ask questions and learn more about the fuel that provides over half of Indiana's electricity.<br>
                Participants will also be able to see demonstrations of equipment, disscusions with coal industry personnel, examine displays, and gain support from members of the coal industry all in order to help students experience hands on activities in the underground mine as well as presentations and a continuous miner simulator to help students witness coal extraction in a simulated setting.<br>
