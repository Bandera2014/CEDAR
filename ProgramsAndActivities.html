            <h2>Coal Days</h2>
            <p>
                Our Coal Days is an opportunity that allow participants (mostly elementary and high school students)  to learn more about the coal industry and coal mining through many different ways.<br>
                On Coal Days Participants have the opportunity to interact with members of the Indiana coal industry firsthand to ask questions and learn more about the fuel that provides over half of Indiana's electricity.<br>
                Participants will also be able to see demonstrations of equipment, disscusions with coal industry personnel, examine displays, and gain support from members of the coal industry all in order to help students experience hands on activities in the underground mine as well as presentations and a continuous miner simulator to help students witness coal extraction in a simulated setting.<br>
